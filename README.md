**nanocode-ts** - minimalistic implementation of coding agent in TypeScript.

## Intention

The intention of this repo for **my** learning purposes. If you would like to learn how coding agent works, the best way is to use some coding agent like Claude Code and ask it to build a minimalistic implementation of coding agent step by step for learning purposes. You may use a prompt like this:

> I'd like to understand how coding agents like Claude Code and Codex work. Please, create a plan on how to build a minimalistic coding agent step by step, so I can follow the plan.
>
> - For each step, mention what I learned on that step, and how may I play with it to understand it better.
> - Make sure, that code generated by plan is very straightforward and easy to understand.
> - Each step should be one more step to the final results of minimalistic coding agent. Don't introduce tools and features which are not going to stay in final version.
> - Please, user TypeScript as I'm familiar with this language.
> - Use OpenRouter as LLM provider.
> - Don't introduce third-party libraries, only built-in node.js packages.

## Features

- Tools: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `glob`, `grep` and `bash`
- Colored terminal output
- LLM calls stats: execution time, tokens usage, price per call
- Safety:
  - Confirm execution of `bash` commands
  - Avoid infinite agentic loop

## Running

```bash
cp .env.example .env

# Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` inside `.env`

npm i

npm start
```

## Commands

- `/new` - Clear conversation
- `/exite` - Quit
